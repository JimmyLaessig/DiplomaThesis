\section{State of the Art}
Extensive research has been performed on shape detection and segmentation of point-clouds. Model-based methods aim to segment the point-cloud into a set of geometric shapes, where points belonging to the same shape share the same mathematical representation. 
\\
Tarsha-Kurdi\cite{tarsha2007hough} analyses the performance of 3D hough-transform and RANSAC for detecting roof plane from airbourne laser data. The RANSAC proves to be more robust to noise and more efficient.
\\
Schnabel et al. \cite{schnabel-2007-efficient} propose an automated solution that utilizes RANSAC to extract a minimal set of primitive shapes that approximates the global structure of the point-cloud.  
\\
GlobFit is a system by Li et al. \cite{li2011globfit} that aims to recover a set of locally fitted primitives, obtained by RANSAC, along with their global mutual relations. The authors work under the assumption that primitives occur repeatedly, so global relations are iteratively learned and enforced on the local relations. 

Graph-based methods have the advantage of providing robust segmentation while being highly efficient. Golovinskiy et al. \cite{golovinskiy2009min} build a 3D graph from a point-cloud using k-nearest neighbors A soft penalty is used to extract the background and foreground and a min-cut is performed to detect the final segmented object interactively. 

Strom et al. \cite{strom2010graph} extend the graph-theoretic segmentation method from \cite{felzenszwalb2004efficient} from image domain into point-cloud domain. This paper introduces a dynamic segment union criterion based on surface color and normals to produce a quality segmentation.
