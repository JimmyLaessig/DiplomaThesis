\section{State of the Art}
Extensive research has been performed on shape detection and segmentation of point-clouds. Model-based methods aim to segment the point-cloud into a set of geometric shapes, where points belonging to the same shape share the same mathematical representation. 
\\
Tarsha-Kurdi\cite{tarsha2007hough} analyses the performance of 3D hough-transform and RANSAC for detecting roof plane from airbourne laser data. The RANSAC proves to be more robust to noise and more efficient.
\\
Schnabel et al. \cite{schnabel-2007-efficient} propose an automated solution that utilizes RANSAC to extract a minimal set of primitive shapes that approximates the global structure of the point-cloud.  
\\
GlobFit is a system by Li et al. \cite{li2011globfit} that aims to recover a set of locally fitted primitives, obtained by RANSAC, along with their global mutual relations. The authors work under the assumption that primitives occur repeatedly, so global relations are iteratively learned and enforced on the local relations. 

Graph-based methods have the advantage of providing high accuracy
