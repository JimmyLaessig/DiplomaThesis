	abstract = {In this work we present an automatic algorithm to detect basic shapes in unorganized point clouds.
	The algorithm decomposes the point cloud into a concise, hybrid structure of inherent shapes and a
	set of remaining points. Each detected shape serves as a proxy for a set of corresponding points.
	Our method is based on random sampling and detects planes, spheres, cylinders, cones and tori. For
	models with surfaces composed of these basic shapes only, e.g. CAD models, we automatically obtain a
	representation solely consisting of shape proxies. We demonstrate that the algorithm is robust even
	in the presence of many outliers and a high degree of noise. The proposed method scales well with
	respect to the size of the input point cloud and the number and size of the shapes within the data.
	Even point sets with several millions of samples are robustly decomposed within less than a minute.
	Moreover the algorithm is conceptually simple and easy to implement. Application areas include
	measurement of physical parameters, scan registration, surface compression, hybrid rendering, shape
	classification, meshing, simplification, approximation and reverse engineering.}

	abstract =   "In this paper, we introduce a novel reconstruction and
	modeling pipeline to create polygonal models from
	unstructured point clouds. We propose an automatic polygonal
	reconstruction that can then be interactively refined by the
	user. An initial model is automatically created by
	extracting a set of RANSAC-based locally fitted planar
	primitives along with their boundary polygons, and then
	searching for local adjacency relations among parts of the
	polygons. The extracted set of adjacency relations is
	enforced to snap polygon elements together, while
	simultaneously fitting to the input point cloud and ensuring
	the planarity of the polygons. This optimization-based
	snapping algorithm may also be interleaved with user
	interaction. This allows the user to sketch modifications
	with coarse and loose 2D strokes, as the exact alignment of
	the polygons is automatically performed by the snapping. The
	generated models are coarse, offer simple editing
	possibilities by design and are suitable for interactive 3D
	applications like games, virtual environments etc. The main
	innovation in our approach lies in the tight coupling
	between interactive input and automatic optimization, as
	well as in an algorithm that robustly discovers the set of
	adjacency relations.",
