\section{Motivation \& Problem Definition}
Segmentation is a fundamental step in processing point-clouds. Clustering a point-cloud into neighboring regions can help the user to understand local and global structures. Moreover, it can be used to introduce semantic information into a unstructured data, providing the user with more interaction possibilities. Current solutions, such as presented in \cite{schnabel-2007-efficient}, \cite{schnabel-2007-ransac} can already produce precise segmentations of point-clouds. However, the runtime of these algorithms increases with the size of the point-cloud, so producing results for billions of points is not feasible in real-time. However, when looking at raw numbers, the approach by Schnabel et al. \cite{schnabel-2007-ransac} delivers promising results for point-clouds of smaller size (\textless 12.000 points) in a fraction of a second.

Point-cloud datasets have grown in size at such a rapid pace that they are now simply too large to fit into system memory, yet alone graphics card memory. Therefore new solutions for out-of-core representations have emerged. The point-cloud is stored in a cached file on the hard drive and therefore cannot be accessed directly. Based on a culling heuristic, chunks of point-cloud data are loaded into memory when being processed or rendered. This continuous swapping of data yields the memory bandwidth as another potential bottleneck when it comes to performance.

This thesis presents a top-down approach to detect shapes using a level-of-detail representation of point-clouds. Instead of segmenting the whole point-cloud at once, we utilize the users input to extract regions of interest that can be segmented within a fraction of a second, thus providing the user with immediate geometrical information on the currently focused area. Moreover, selecting points in point-clouds can be tedious and cumbersome. This thesis presents several interactions, that utilize the geometric information in order to streamline the users' workflow.
