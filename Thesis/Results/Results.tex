\chapter{Results}
\label{chap:results}

All results are obtained on a PC with an AMD FX-9590, 16 GB RAM and an AMD Radeon HD 7970. The datasets Technologiezentrum and JB\_Haus are a courtesy of rmData\cite{rmdata}. Section \ref{sec:shape_detection_results} shows benchmarks for the shape detection and verifies the capability of the user-guided shape detection to be performed in interactive time. Section \ref{sec:interaction_results} provides a set of screenshots that show the workflow of the user-guided interactions on a different data set. 


\section{Shape Detection Results}
\label{sec:shape_detection_results}

The interactions proposed in this thesis heavily rely on the ability to detect meaningful shapes for regions of interest within interactive time. Therefore it must be assured that the shape detection provides results within interactive time such that the detected shapes can be used immediately for interactions. Section \ref{sec:shape_detection_performance} discusses the performance obtained in the test computer. Section \ref{sec:shape_detection_problems} discusses flaws of the shape detection algorithm that occurred while implementing this thesis.


\subsection{Performance}

\label{sec:shape_detection_performance}

The goal of the \textit{user-guided shape detection} is to provide meaningful results within interactive time, such that detected shapes can be used to support interactions immediately. The capabilities of the implementation by Schnabel et al. \cite{schnabel-2007-software} are benchmarked on three different datasets: 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ l | r | r | r }
																	& \textbf{\#Points}	& \textbf{\#Nodes}	& \textbf{max. LoD} \\
    \hline
  JB\_Haus.pts                    & 620.722           & 440             	& 15 \\
  Technologiezentrum\_Teil1.pts   & 11.762.924        & 8863             	& 15 \\
  Synthetic\_Primitives.pts     	& 472.000           & 315               & 5 \\
    
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The tests are performed without user interaction. Instead, all octree nodes are collected and fed into the shape detection routine sequentially to retrieve results for each node of the point cloud. Therefore, the shape detection is performed for the complete point cloud for each level-of-detail. Each octree node contains at most 5000 points. The results are averaged over five runs. Table \ref{table:schnabel_benchmarks} shows the results averaged over all nodes. It can be seen that detecting planes only is significantly faster than detecting all types of primitive shapes. However, detecting all types of primitive shapes still produces results within interactive time. The synthetic point cloud is constructed from a set of primitives that are discretized to point sets, such that all types of primitives exist.

\end{figure}


Figure \ref{fig:shapes_total_vs_lod} shows the total number of shapes per level-of-detail. All three datasets share an increase in the number of shapes in the third quarter before a rapid decline for the highest level-of-detail. Figure \ref{fig:shapes_averaged_vs_lod} shows the number of shapes divided by the number of nodes per level-of-detail. Both figures emphasize that the majority of shapes is not found in the highest level-of-detail. Reasons for this is that many nodes only contain a handful of points or only contain a single structure. 
\\

Figure \ref{fig:time_vs_lod} shows the calculation time compared to the level-of-detail. Shape detection for smaller, more dense nodes take less time than for larger nodes with lower level-of-detail as in larger nodes, usually more shapes are found. 


\subsection{Problems and undesired Behavior}
\label{sec:shape_detection_problems}
A problem with the shape detection implementation by Schnabel et al. \cite{schnabel-2007-software} are reoccurring non-terminations for some octree nodes, causing the shape detection coroutine to stall. To circumvent this problem, all shape detection tasks that are dispatched to the \verb|sequential computation applicator| are assigned a timeout value of one second, after which the computation is interrupted. 
\\
Another reoccurring problem with the shape detection is the plausibility of detected shapes. The RANSAC options guarantee that shapes are found that fit the local geometry within a certain margin, $\alpha$ for the normal's angle and $\epsilon$ for the distance the shape. So within theses two parameters, the shape is considered to be valid. However, certain constellations of points allow the shape detection to produce non-plausible results that are accurate regarding the RANSAC parameters but are not plausible to the eye. A prominent example is a torus that is fitted onto a section that describes a cylinder. The major radius of the torus is of such dimensions that the local cylinder fits within the curvature of the torus. Thus, a torus is detected, rather than the simpler cylinder. Figure \ref{fig:missfittedTorus} shows this behavior within an example scene that consists multiple primitives. Figure \ref{fig:missfittedTorus2} shows the size of the detected torus. 
\\
Such non-plausible shapes can exist due to the density-controlled $\epsilon$ parameter that weakens the margin for octree nodes of larger volume. Even within a node, the density can strongly vary for different regions.

{This figure shows a cylinder from the synthetic point cloud whose points are classified as a torus instead of a cylinder. Even tough the points fit the torus, determined by the RANSAC options, the result is not plausible, since the user would expect a cylinder for this constellation of points. }

\subsection{Results}

This section presents results for the RANSAC shape detection performed on three data sets. The results in Figure \ref{fig:synthetic_point_cloud_results}, \ref{fig:JB_haus_results}, and \ref{fig:technologiezentrum_results} are obtained by segmenting the point clouds as a whole. Results for the interactive shape detection can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:technologiezentrum_interactive_shape_detection}. 

The synthetic test scene consists of two planes, three cylinders, three tori, and three cones.  Figure \ref{fig:synthetic_point_cloud_results} shows the synthetic point cloud, as well as the shapes that are detected within the point cloud. As the RANSAC approach randomly selects a subset of points, the results can be different for different runs.
