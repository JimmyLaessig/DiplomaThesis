	reconstruction that can then be interactively refined by the
	user. An initial model is automatically created by
	extracting a set of RANSAC-based locally fitted planar
	primitives along with their boundary polygons, and then
	searching for local adjacency relations among parts of the
	polygons. The extracted set of adjacency relations is
	enforced to snap polygon elements together, while
	simultaneously fitting to the input point cloud and ensuring
	the planarity of the polygons. This optimization-based
	snapping algorithm may also be interleaved with user
	interaction. This allows the user to sketch modifications
	with coarse and loose 2D strokes, as the exact alignment of
	the polygons is automatically performed by the snapping. The
	generated models are coarse, offer simple editing
	possibilities by design and are suitable for interactive 3D
	applications like games, virtual environments etc. The main
	innovation in our approach lies in the tight coupling
	between interactive input and automatic optimization, as
	well as in an algorithm that robustly discovers the set of

	The algorithm decomposes the point cloud into a concise, hybrid structure of inherent shapes and a
	set of remaining points. Each detected shape serves as a proxy for a set of corresponding points.
	Our method is based on random sampling and detects planes, spheres, cylinders, cones and tori. For
	models with surfaces composed of these basic shapes only, e.g. CAD models, we automatically obtain a
	representation solely consisting of shape proxies. We demonstrate that the algorithm is robust even
	in the presence of many outliers and a high degree of noise. The proposed method scales well with
	respect to the size of the input point cloud and the number and size of the shapes within the data.
	Even point sets with several millions of samples are robustly decomposed within less than a minute.
	Moreover the algorithm is conceptually simple and easy to implement. Application areas include
	measurement of physical parameters, scan registration, surface compression, hybrid rendering, shape
	classification, meshing, simplification, approximation and reverse engineering.}

  title =      "Interactions with Gigantic Point Clouds",
  author =     "Claus Scheiblauer",
  year =       "2014",
  abstract =   "During the last decade the increased use of laser
               range-scanners for sampling the environment has led to
               gigantic point cloud data sets. Due to the size of such data
               sets, tasks like viewing, editing, or presenting the data
               have become a challenge per se, as the point data is too
               large to fit completely into the main memory of a customary
               computer system. In order to accomplish these tasks and
               enable the interaction with gigantic point clouds on
               consumer grade computer systems, this thesis presents novel
               methods and data structures for efficiently dealing with
               point cloud data sets consisting of more than 109 point
               samples.   To be able to access point samples fast that are
               stored on disk or in memory, they have to be spatially
               ordered, and for this a data structure is proposed which
               organizes the points samples in a level-of-detail hierarchy.
               Point samples stored in this hierarchy cannot only be
               rendered fast, but can also be edited, for example existing
               points can be deleted from the hierarchy or new points can
               be inserted. Furthermore, the data structure is memory
               efficient, as it only uses the point samples from the
               original data set. Therefore, the memory consumption of the
               point samples on disk, when stored in this data structure,
               is comparable to the original data set. A second data
               structure is proposed for selecting points. This data
               structure describes a volume inside which point samples are
               considered to be selected, and this has the advantage that
               the information about a selection does not have to be stored
               at the point samples.   In addition to these two previously
               mentioned data structures, which represent novel
               contributions for point data visualization and manipulation,
               methods for supporting the presentation of point data sets
               are proposed. With these methods the user experience can be
               enhanced when navigating through the data. One possibility
               to do this is by using regional meshes that employ an
               out-of-core texturing method to show details in the
               mesoscopic scale on the surface of sampled objects, and
               which are displayed together with point clouds. Another
               possibility to increase the user experience is to use graphs
               in 3D space, which helps users to orient themselves inside
               point cloud models of large sites, where otherwise it would
               be difficult to find the places of interest. Furthermore,
               the quality of the displayed point cloud models can be
               increased by using a point size heuristics that can mimic a
               closed surface in areas that would otherwise appear
               undersampled, by utilizing the density of the rendered
               points in the different areas of the point cloud model.  
               Finally, the use of point cloud models as a tool for
               archaeological work is proposed. Since it becomes
               increasingly common to document archaeologically interesting
               monuments with laser scanners, the number application areas
               of the resulting point clouds is raising as well. These
               include, but are not limited to, new views of the monument
               that are impossible when studying the monument on-site,
               creating cuts and floor plans, or perform virtual
               anastylosis.   All these previously mentioned methods and
               data structures are implemented in a single software
               application that has been developed during the course of
               this thesis and can be used to interactively explore
               gigantic point clouds.",

	large point clouds. It allows users to view data sets with
	billions of points, from sources such as LIDAR or
	photogrammetry, in real time in standard web browsers. One
	of the main advantages of point cloud visualization in web
	browser is that it allows users to share their data sets
	with clients or the public without the need to install
	third-party applications and transfer huge amounts of data
	in advance. The focus on large point clouds, and a variety
	of measuring tools, also allows users to use Potree to look
	at, analyze and validate raw point cloud data, without the
	need for a time-intensive and potentially costly meshing
	step. The streaming and rendering of billions of points in
	web browsers, without the need to load large amounts of data
	in advance, is achieved with a hierarchical structure that
	stores subsamples of the original data at different
	resolutions. A low resolution is stored in the root node and
	with each level, the resolution gradually increases. The
	structure allows Potree to cull regions of the point cloud
	that are outside the view frustum, and to render distant
	regions at a lower level of detail. The result is an open
	source point cloud viewer, which was able to render point
	cloud data sets of up to 597 billion points, roughly 1.6
	terabytes after compression, in real time in a web browser.",
