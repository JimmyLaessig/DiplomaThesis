	abstract = {In this work we present an automatic algorithm to detect basic shapes in unorganized point clouds.
	The algorithm decomposes the point cloud into a concise, hybrid structure of inherent shapes and a
	set of remaining points. Each detected shape serves as a proxy for a set of corresponding points.
	Our method is based on random sampling and detects planes, spheres, cylinders, cones and tori. For
	models with surfaces composed of these basic shapes only, e.g. CAD models, we automatically obtain a
	representation solely consisting of shape proxies. We demonstrate that the algorithm is robust even
	in the presence of many outliers and a high degree of noise. The proposed method scales well with
	respect to the size of the input point cloud and the number and size of the shapes within the data.
	Even point sets with several millions of samples are robustly decomposed within less than a minute.
	Moreover the algorithm is conceptually simple and easy to implement. Application areas include
	measurement of physical parameters, scan registration, surface compression, hybrid rendering, shape
	classification, meshing, simplification, approximation and reverse engineering.}

	abstract =   "This thesis introduces Potree, a web-based renderer for
	large point clouds. It allows users to view data sets with
	billions of points, from sources such as LIDAR or
	photogrammetry, in real time in standard web browsers. One
	of the main advantages of point cloud visualization in web
	browser is that it allows users to share their data sets
	with clients or the public without the need to install
	third-party applications and transfer huge amounts of data
	in advance. The focus on large point clouds, and a variety
	of measuring tools, also allows users to use Potree to look
	at, analyze and validate raw point cloud data, without the
	need for a time-intensive and potentially costly meshing
	step. The streaming and rendering of billions of points in
	web browsers, without the need to load large amounts of data
	in advance, is achieved with a hierarchical structure that
	stores subsamples of the original data at different
	resolutions. A low resolution is stored in the root node and
	with each level, the resolution gradually increases. The
	structure allows Potree to cull regions of the point cloud
	that are outside the view frustum, and to render distant
	regions at a lower level of detail. The result is an open
	source point cloud viewer, which was able to render point
	cloud data sets of up to 597 billion points, roughly 1.6
	terabytes after compression, in real time in a web browser.",
