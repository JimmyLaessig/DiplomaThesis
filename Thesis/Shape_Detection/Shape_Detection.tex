\section{Efficient RANSAC for Point-Cloud Shape Detection}
Schnabel et. al\cite{schnabel-2007-efficient} propose an automated way for detecting simple primitive shapes in unstructured point clouds. The point cloud is decomposed into a set of shapes and a set unused points. The algorithm supports the following primitive shapes: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Plane
	\item Sphere
	\item Cylinder
	\item Cone
	\item Torus
\end{itemize} 

\textbf{RAN}dom \textbf{SA}mpling \textbf{C}onsens (RANSAC) was first discussed by Fischler and Bolles\cite{fischler1981random} as a paradigm for model fitting for image analysis and automated cartography. However, this approach can be generalized for points with an origin other than images. 

The shape detection utilizes RANSAC to repeatedly take a minimal set of points that describe a primitive shape. Points that are within a distance $\epsilon$ and whose
whose normals do not deviate from the normal of the shape more than a given angle $\alpha$.
