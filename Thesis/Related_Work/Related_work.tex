The scope of this thesis is on management of massive point clouds, shape detection in, and interactions with point clouds. This chapter discusses work that has inspired this thesis. Section \ref{sec:related_work_point_clouds} presents related work on storing and rendering out-of-core point clouds, Section \ref{sec:related_work_shape detection} provides different techniques for shape detection in point clouds and further processing. Related work on interactions is presented in Section \ref{sec:related_work_interactions}.
