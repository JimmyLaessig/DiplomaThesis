\section{Functional Programming}
\label{sec:funprog
}
Functional programming is a paradigm that views every expression as a mathematical function. The result of each expression is either an elemental datatype or a functional type. A core difference to other programming paradigms is the equality of function and data, such that functions can be used as input for other functions and have a distinct type defined by its parameters and result. A simple example of a function in \verb|F#|: 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=FSharp]
let square (i : float) : float = i * i 
\end{lstlisting}

This function is of type \verb|float -> float|. It takes a \verb|float| as input and returns a \verb|float|. This functional type can be used as input parameter as well. A definition for a function that takes a function as parameter looks as follows: 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=FSharp]
let compute (i: float)(f : float -> float) : float = f i
\end{lstlisting}
Its type is \verb|float -> (float -> float) -> float| and is used as such: 
\begin{lstlisting}[language=FSharp]
let result = compute 10.0 square
\end{lstlisting}

\verb|result| is an expression that executes the \verb|compute| function with arguments $10.0$ of type \verb|float| and \verb|square| of type \verb|float -> float|. Even tough this is just a simple example, it showcases the strength of functional programming.  Using functions as input allows the user to create complex and dynamic computations with ease. 
\\

Functional programming tries to mitigate mutations as much as possible. Mutations, e.g. change of a variable's state, introduces several risks to the program. While each expression in a function context is mathematically defined, such that parameter space and result space are fully defined, now values are returned that the program does not expect, thus mitigating undefined behavior. Moreover, mutation of an expression can change the behavior of expressions that depend in the mutated field, thus changing the result, without changing the parameter. 
\\

\verb|F#|\cite{FSharp} is a functional programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft\cite{Microsoft}. F\# is fully integrated into the .NET framework\cite{DotNet} and is built upon the Common Language Infrastructure\cite{CLI}, thus allowing it to use resources written in other languages, such as C\#\cite{CSharp}. Even though F\# is a functional language, it also supports object-oriented programming, such that types with member functions can be used as well. 


\section{Aardvark}
The Aardvark platform\cite{aardvark} is a functional-first incremental rendering engine in active development at the VRVis Zentrum f√ºr Virtual Reality und Visualisierung\cite{vrvis}. It is an implementation of research results on the field of incremental rendering \cite{, lazy} and semantic shader composition\cite{haaser2014cosmo, haaser2014semantic}. 

The key feature of the Aardvark platform is incremental rendering. In a conventional engine, updates are performed periodically. each object in the scene is reevaluated, even tough the simulation or user-input did not yield any changes. Incremental rendering counters this overhead by reacting to changes, such that only parts that depend on changed values are reevaluated. This section describes some of Aardvark's key features that are used throughout this thesis. Section \ref{sec:adaptive} shows the language-specific constructs on how to build adaptive blocks that react to changes. A \textit{scene graph} represents an object hierarchy in the scene. Section \ref{sec:isg} describes the composition of a scene graph using only a handful of lines of code. 

 
\subsection{Adaptive - IMod - transact}
\label{sec:adaptive}
As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:funprog} mutations are often the cause of undefined behavior and bugs. In order to introduce state-changeable variables into a functional environment, Aardvark provides the \verb|IMod<'a>| type. This generic type is a wrapper around a certain value, whose value might change over time. The platform contains an extensive implementation for a three-dimensional transformation, called \verb|Trafo3d|. In order to listen to changes for such a transformation, a type \verb|IMod<Trafo3d>| is needed. The following example shows the composition of a model transformation from a position, scale, and rotation, all of which can might their value over time. 

\begin{lstlisting}[language = FSharp]

let position     : IMod<V3d> = ... 
let scale         : IMod<V3d> = ... 
let rotation    : IMod<V3d> = ...

let trafo : IMod<Trafo3d> = 
    adaptive {
    
        let! sc  = scale
        let! rot = rotation
        let! pos = position
        
        
        let S = Trafo3d.scale sc
        let R = Trafo3d.Rotation rot
        let T = Trafo3d.Translation pos
        
        return S * R * T
    }
\end{lstlisting}
The \verb|adaptive| block allows the system to keep track of the state of all IMods that are accessed using the \verb|let!| operator. The result of the adaptive block, again, is an IMod<Trafo3d>. If one of the accessed IMods changes its value, the code below, including the line of the \verb|let!| is reevaluated using the previously caches values. 
\\

To actively change a value, a subtype of \verb|IMod<'a>|, \verb|ModRef<'a>| is needed. The type \verb|ModRef<'a>| contains the functionality to allow changes to the value, thus causing reevaluation. All state transactions are collected and executed sequentially, thus reducing the number of reevaluations and circumventing race-conditions. In order to achieve that each change must be wrapped in a \verb|transact| type. 
The following example uses the Aardvark-specific mouse callback function to trigger a reevaluation based on mouse movement. The Move-callback is called each time the mouse moves and provides the user with the old position and the new position. The difference on the x-axis controls the y-value of the rotation. 

\begin{lstlisting}[language = FSharp]
let mouse : IMouse = ...

let rotation : ModRef<V3d> = Mod.init V3d.OOO

mouse.Move.Values.Add(fun (oldPos : PixelPosition, newPos : PixelPosition) -> 
    let delta = 
			newPos.NormalizedPosition.X - oldPos.NormalizedPosition.X
    let angle = delta * 2.0 * Math.Pi
    
    let newRotation = 
			rotation.GetValue() + V3d(0.0, angle, 0.0)
    
    transact(fun () -> Mod.change rotation newRotation)
    )
\end{lstlisting}

The \verb|rotation| can then be used within an \verb|adaptive| block like an \verb|IMod|. 
\\
Transactions are usually used to handle user input. However, asynchronous computations that produce results in parallel use transactions as well in order to mitigate race conditions and notify the system. 


\subsection{Scene graph composition}
\label{sec:isg}
A scenegraph (\verb|ISg|) contains all information that is needed to render this object. A common paradigm in functional programming is to split functionality from data, such that the functions that utilize this data, are stored in a different namespace than the data. In combination with the pipe operator ($|>$) clean and easy-to-read code can be produced. The following example showcases the composition of an \verb|ISg|. 

\begin{lstlisting}[language = FSharp]

// Transformations
let trafo:	IMod<Trafo3d> = ... 
let view:	IMod<Trafo3d> = ...
let proj:	IMod<Trafo3d> = ...

// IndexedGeometry contains triangles to render
let geometry : IndexedGeometry = ...

// The renderpass for this scenegraph
let renderPass : RenderPass = ...
// The shader (surface) to render the geometry with
let shader : IMod<ISurface> = ...
// Create scenegraph
let sg = geometry	|> Sg.ofIndexedGeometry
                    |> Sg.trafo trafo
                    |> Sg.viewTrafo view
                    |> Sg.projTrafo proj
                    |> Sg.pass renderPass
                    |> Sg.surface shader
\end{lstlisting}

The field \verb|sg| represents a scene graph with transformations, geometry, shader and render pass without the need of complicated constructors or setter functions. Furthermore, an own implementation of \verb|ISg| can easily extend the functionality without reimplemented procedures for this specific type. 


\subsection{Out-of-core capabilites}
The Aardvark platform already implements functionality to handle out-of-core data. The type \verb|Database| provides means to store data. A chunk of data that is stored on in this database is called \verb|thunk<'a>| where \verb|'a| is the type of the data to be stored. The following code shows hot to create a \verb|thunk<'a>|. 

\begin{lstlisting}[language = FSharp]
	let db : Database	= ...
	let data : 'a 	= ...
	
	let stored : thunk<'a> = db.ref data
\end{lstlisting}
When a thunk is loaded from the database its content is not loaded into memory yet. Only when accessing the data directly, it is loaded into memory. 
\\
The data is held in memory as long as a thunk lives. Therefore it is crucial to keep track of unused thunks and dispose them regularly, thus freeing memory. 
 

\section{Functional Out-of-core Octree}

The structure of the octree is already described in Chapter \ref{chap:octree}. However, this section describes implementation details of the octree, such as data types and additional functionalities. 
TODO!!

\subsection{Structure}

The octree's out-of-core capability is managed by an interleaved structure of thunks. Each \verb|OctreeNode| contains an array of points. However, the array is not stored directly, it is stored as a \verb|thunk<Point[]>|. It's children are stored as an array of thunks (\verb|thunk<OctreeNode>[]|). While the points are stored in one reference, the reason for storing the node's children in separate thunks is to not load all children into memory when only a subset of children is accessed. Other information such as the centroid, density and the detected primitive shapes are stored as thunks as well. 


\subsection{Elementar Functions}

The interaction methods described in Section \ref{chap:interactions} heavily rely on the efficient collection of octree nodes that fulfill certain criteria, thus a collection of routines is implemented that can easily be parametrized and reused. \verb|F#| collections contain several functions that use a function as input and performs this function on elements in the collection. Some examples for arrays are: \verb|Array.map, Array.filter| and \verb|Array.choose|, all of which take two arguments, an array and a function whose input parameter is the element type. Even though the octree is not generic, these functions are implemented in an adapted way, in order to provide efficient query functions on the octree. 

\subsubsection{Filter}

A common procedure in functional programming is filtering. Filtering is performed on a collection and returns the set of elements of this collection for which the decision function is \verb|true|. Filtering an octree is similar. However, the decision must be made if to use the current node and if to traverse the children as well, as children may be desired, where the parent is not. 
The function's definition looks as follows: 

\begin{lstlisting}[language = FSharp]
let filter (decisionFun : OctreeNode -> GridCell -> int[] -> bool*bool) (tree: Octree) : (Octree)= ...
\end{lstlisting}

The decision function takes as input the octree node, it's grid cell and it's unique path in the octree as array of indices. It returns a tuple of \verb|bool|, deciding whether to use this node and whether to traverse the children. The result of this operation is a new tree that only contains the nodes that are filtered. For the case that a parent node is not filtered, but some of it's children are, an empty placeholder node is used instead to preserve the octree's structure. 


\subsubsection{Map}
Usually, the \verb|map| function is used for generic data structures to create a projection for each element and returns a data structure of the same type with the projected elements. Since the octree is not generic, the \verb|map| function returns the projection for each node of the octree as an array of \verb|'T| where \verb|'T| is the type of the projection. 
The functions's definition looks as follows: 

\begin{lstlisting}[language = FSharp]
let map (projection : OctreeNode -> GridCell -> int[] -> 'T) (tree: Octree) : ('T[])= ...
\end{lstlisting}

Contrary to the filter function, the \verb|map| function does not return a new octree since the type of the projection must not necessarily be hierarchical. Therefore an array of \verb|'T| is returned instead. 

\subsubsection{Choose}

A similar task to filtering is the choose function. However, instead of returning the filtered values directly, the decision function also maps the values to the desired type \verb|'T|. The decision function uses the same input as the decision function for filtering. It's return type is a tuple that consists of a \verb|Option<'T>| and a \verb|bool|. The option type is used to introduce null-mechanics into the functional context. An option can either be \verb|Some value| or \verb|None|. If the \verb|choose| function's returned type is \verb|Some value|, it's value is filtered, the \verb|bool| value decides whether or not to traverse the children. 
The function's definition looks as follows: 

\begin{lstlisting}[language = FSharp]
let choose (decisionFun : OctreeNode -> GridCell -> int[] -> Option<'T>*bool) (tree: Octree) :('T[]) = ...
\end{lstlisting}

Only nodes are returned that fulfill the decision function and are projected to a new type $t_{i}$. }

\subsubsection{Replacing Nodes}

As mutations introduce side effects that can lead to bugs, instead of changing information within an octree node, a new node is created containing the new information. The old node might still be in use in a different thread, thus race conditions are possible, when mutating values. When information changes in an octree node, a new \verb|thunk| is created that stores the new content onto the disc, the old \verb|thunk| is disposed when it is not used anymore. The newly created node has a distinct position that is determined by the path in the octree. The octree is traversed recursively to find the position of the node. 
\\
When the recursion is resolved, The content of all ancestor nodes has changed as well, since one of the children is a new node. Therefore, for each ancestor, a new node is created too, containing the new content. Since the root changes as well, as the replaced node is a successor of it, a new octree is constructed each time a node is replaced. This octree, however, contains mostly the data of the old octree, with the exception of the replaced node. 
\\
Figure \ref{fig:octreeReplace} shows an example on the replacement of a node. The nodes are labeled with their paths in the octree in order to uniquely identify them. The node with label \verb|[1,2]| is replaced, thus all ancestors in the octree are changed as well, since the node got a new child. All nodes that changed, thus creating a new octree, are colored in orange. 

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{Implementation/octreeReplace.png}
    \caption{Replacing an octree node subsequently changes the node's ancestors as well. The left tree shows the original octree, the right tree is the new octree after the node [1,0] was replaced. The replaced node is highlighted with a red border, all nodes that changed due to the replacement are colored in orange. }
    \label{fig:octreeReplace}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Culling}
Culling directly uses the octree's \verb|filter| function to create a new octree that only contains nodes that are currently rendered. The culling function performs view-frustum culling as well as a culling heuristic based on the node's distance to the nearplane and it's size. 


\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Implementation/octreeCulling.png}
    \caption{An exemplary culling is performed on a tree. Octree nodes that are darker and have a thicker edge have a higher \textit{leve-of-detail}. Only close to the camera (red) the nodes with the highest \textit{level-of-detail} are rendered. Nodes that are outside the view frustum(orange) are discarded. }
    \label{fig:octreeCulling}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Diff}

As discussed in Section \ref{sec:renderHorizon}, the render horizon is the set of nodes that are still rendered, and one of the children is not rendered anymore. The \textit{Shape-Assisted Local Level-of-Detail Increment} interaction, described in Section \ref{sec:lod_increment} uses the render horizon to collect a set of nodes that is beyond the horizon to draw additional points onto the screen. This set of nodes is obtained by the octree's \verb|diff| function. 
\\
Let $t1, t2$ be two octrees where $t2$ is a sub tree of $t1$. The function \verb|diff t1 t2| returns all nodes from t1, whose parents exist in t1 and t2, but the node itself only exists in t1.
\\
The \verb|diff| function takes nodes that are in the first octree and not in the second octree. In the case of the \textit{Shape-Assisted Local Level-of-Detail Increment} interaction $t1$ is the complete octree, $t2$ is the culled octree that only contains nodes that are rendered. 
\\
Additionally, not only the children are collected, but depending on a depth value, the childrens' successors are collected as well. 


\subsection{Raycast}

An octree is an ideal data structure to accelerate raycasting. The hierarchical structure ensures that only a minimum set of nodes is tested for intersection. If the ray does not intersect the parent's bounding box, it does not intersect the childrens' bounding boxes as well. The raycast is implemented using the octree's \verb|choose| function with a decision function that performs the intersection with the bounding box and returns a \verb|RaycastHit| structure containing all neccessary information on the raycast hit.
